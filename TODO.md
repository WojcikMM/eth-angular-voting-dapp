# List of tasks TODO:
* use custom webpack to support :
```json
{
  "browser": {
    "crypto": true,
    "stream": true,
    "fs": "empty"
  }
}
```
* maybe add/create new one library with copy-abi-files & custom webpack for web3 angular configuration
* change type of BaseContractService to not be a AbstractClass ( it fails on unit tests)
